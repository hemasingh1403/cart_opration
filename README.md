# cart_opration
This Python program simulates a simple shopping cart system. The user can start the cart, add items, view the cart, and checkout with a final bill that includes a discount (if applicable) and delivery charges. The program runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple actions until they choose to exit.
